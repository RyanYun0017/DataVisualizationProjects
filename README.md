# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is The Car Selling Details in India. It collect the many attributs about car transaction in a long range of time. 

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created two proof of concept visualization of this data. 

### The first one is a scatter plot of the selling price and car' s mileage before sold.

### The second one is a bar chart between the producing year (of the car) and the selling price.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How will the car's mileage affect its selling price?
 * Try to give a plot of year vs. selling_price under different car type and car brand.
 * What is the most popular seller type under different car brand or mileage.

## Sketches

I made two hand draws of the Car Selling Dataset. 
* The upper sketch is to show portions of different brand for selling in this data set.
* The lower sketch is giving a view of how selling price shaped in differnt car mileage. 

## Open Questions

To group different raws sharing the same brand name, I need to give a filter to the car's name. I think it will be a challenge for me.
