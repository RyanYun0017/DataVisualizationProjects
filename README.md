# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is The Car Selling Details in India. It collect the many attributs about car transaction in a long range of time. 

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created two proof of concept visualization of this data. 

### The first one is a scatter plot of the selling price and car' s mileage before sold.

### The second one is a bar chart between the producing year (of the car) and the selling price.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How will the car's mileage affect its selling price?
 * Try to give a plot of year vs. selling_price under different car type and car brand.
 * What is the most popular seller type under different car brand or mileage.
 * I want to finally create a pie chart of this dataset. Each pie in this chart represents the number of sold cars under certain category. For example, the fuel time, the mileage range, the producing year range, or car brand. Viewer can select different category from the top menu, then view the piechart in same page. 

## Sketches

I made two hand draws of the Car Selling Dataset. 
* The upper sketch is to show portions of different brand for selling in this data set.
* The lower sketch is giving a view of how selling price shaped in differnt car mileage. 

## Open Questions

To finish the task for a multi-categories pie chart. I need to fix several problems. At first, I need to sort my dataset under different categories, then create menu through D3 module. I thing this could be the most difficult work in this project.
