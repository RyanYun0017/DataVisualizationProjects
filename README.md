# Data Visualization Project

## Final Project Video

The video is uploaded to the YouTube. Please click this [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0rHCva_L40&ab_channel=YunHaiyang) to see. 

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is The Car Selling Details in India. It collect the many attributs about car transaction in a long range of time. 

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created two proof of concept visualization of this data. 

### The first one is a scatter plot of the selling price and car' s mileage before sold.

### The second one is a bar chart between the producing year (of the car) and the selling price.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How will the car's mileage affect its selling price?
 * Try to give a plot of year vs. selling_price under different car type and car brand.
 * What is the most popular seller type under different car brand or mileage.
 * I want to finally create a pie chart of this dataset. Each pie in this chart represents the number of sold cars under certain category. For example, the fuel time, the mileage range, the producing year range, or car brand. Viewer can select different category from the top menu, then view the piechart in same page. 

## Sketches

I made two hand draws of the Car Selling Dataset. 
* The upper sketch is to show portions of different brand for selling in this data set.
* The lower sketch is giving a view of how selling price shaped in differnt car mileage.

## Update 1: 05-Nov
[![Iterating with Vega-Lite API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14350296/145515684-dd5fe1b8-a78b-4c5a-8129-bf323ef67165.png)](https://vizhub.com/RyanYun0017/be8be10fef604ef48c18950589e44fb4)
I update the scatter plot of Car Selling Details dataset by Vega-Lite API. This method is more user-friendly and fast. I will update this project through this API in the following work. 

## Update 2: 11-Nov
[![Pie Chart with Vega-Lite API](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14350296/145516065-a5c5304b-ff91-466b-8533-f3e187cdf015.png)](https://vizhub.com/RyanYun0017/4f64b1765eee4bfe884654ec40765495)
In this update. I create a new pie chart using the Vega-Lite API. It is clearly show the producing year's distribution of all sold cars in India. 

## Update 3: 25-Nov
[![Mutilple Views](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14350296/145516473-6e149d9c-c344-4229-832f-ce7e46ea31db.png)](https://vizhub.com/RyanYun0017/1ee33c0b245c471fae8028a6fb9c2a9d)
In this update, I created multiple views of Car Selling Details dataset. And made them displayed in the same page. 

## Update 4: 02-Dec - Multiple Views Refined
[![Mutilple Views](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14350296/145516473-6e149d9c-c344-4229-832f-ce7e46ea31db.png)](https://vizhub.com/RyanYun0017/1ee33c0b245c471fae8028a6fb9c2a9d)
Adding tooltips and color legend for the Multiple View Version. 

## Conclusion
After finishing this work, I learned a lot of usefull tools in creating charts and plots with D3 and Vega-Lite. The Car Selling Details dataset is a large dataset with more than 10000 points. I am hoping to sort all the cars name with a certain key word, for example, fillter them by key word "Honda" or "Ford". But this need some JavaScript programming skills which I am not good at. I will keep updating this project and make more good plots. 

### Thanks for Reviewing
